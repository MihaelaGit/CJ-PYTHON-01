"""
Implement a context manager called just_some_exceptions that will handle KeyError, IndexError 
by printing a message and let any other exceptions propagate outside of the context manager.

Implement the context manager by using both approaches: by using class and by using @contextmanager

Write examples that prove the functionality for all the handled exceptions and for one exception that 
is not handled.
