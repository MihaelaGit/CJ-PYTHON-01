# Final Project

Let's build an application that  will store our personal books in a books
collection.

We will with a mutable mapping that describes out books:
class Book( ...):
 ...

 Once a book is created , it cannot be updated !

 There is  also another class DuplicatedBook, derrived from Book class (inheritance),
 which also contains the copy number.
 class DuplicatedBook(Book):
 ...

 We will also  have the BooksCollection  that is a  sequence  that holds our
 personal books .

 class BooksCollection(..):
 ...
We can add books one by one, delete them, and also  using a pick  method  we can be able to
 select a random book or a nominated  one,  from the books collection.


 We will also have  a Library  class, which is   mutable mapping that  hold
   different books .

   class Library():
   ..

   In this class we should be able to check if a book name is available or not into the library.
   Also using a context manager and an overloading operator , we should be able to  design
   some Library  methods ( to be updated).

  We will also  use a mixin class  that will help us to  print   nice the  Book and Library  informations.

 Independently,  we will have to check if  books from our collection are   or are not in the  Library
    and to return a list with  books that are missing  from Library.

This  function  will have a decorator that will store  the common books !
Also, using  a context manager, deal with the IndexError, KeyError and DivisionbyZeroError and some logs  !
