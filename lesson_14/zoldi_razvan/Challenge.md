##### Conversion of units

<blockquote>Conversion of units is the conversion between different units of measurement for the same quantity, typically through multiplicative conversion factors.
There are many different systems of units, so some conversions can be very complex. </blockquote>

#### Units converters

<blockquote>There are many units converters on the market. Two of them you can see below</blockquote>

Example of unit conversion


How many mm in 1 m? The answer is 1000.
We assume you are converting between millimetre and metre.
The SI base unit for length is the metre.
1 metre is equal to 1000 mm, or 1 m.

Quick conversion chart of mm to m
1 mm to m = 0.001 m

10 mm to m = 0.01 m

50 mm to m = 0.05 m

100 mm to m = 0.1 m

200 mm to m = 0.2 m

500 mm to m = 0.5 m

1000 mm to m = 1 m

#### Letâ€™s practice

Using what we've learned until now (including _[Operator Overloading](https://platforma.scoalainformala.ro/pluginfile.php/118570/mod_resource/content/1/Operator_Overloading.pdf)__ ) please create an unit converter from metric system to imperial system and reversed.

<ul>
<li>create a class that converts between psi , bar and N/mm2 (pressure)</li>
<li>create a class that converts between newton [N] to pound-force (lbf) (force)</li>
<li>create a class that converts between any type of units , at your choice</li>
<li>use operator overloading at (at least) one of these classes</li>
</ul>

<b>Bonus :</b> add some very basic interaction with user


```python

```
